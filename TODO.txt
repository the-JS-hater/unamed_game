IMPORTANT
- Collision between entities (Quadtree)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree
	- integrate into an actual collision system
- Rewrtie rendering to account for a 2D camera
	- Sort of done, but needs a player character to follow

SORT OF IMPORTANT
- A player character, or something
	- controls, have the camera following it and so on
- A* to use for path finding in entitites

OPTIMIZATION STUFF
- 'cache' relevant entities on a per-system:s basis
- find a way to not regenerate the quadtree each tick

OTHER
- like... actual gameplay n' stuff
- Audio

KNOWN BUGS
- Double free error when closing the game

NICE THINGS
- tweak dungeon generation
	- If h:w ratios is wacky, prefer to cut it appropriatley, and only use random
		in other cases
