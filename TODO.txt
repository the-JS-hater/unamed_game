OPTIMIZATION STUFF
- probably ALOT of ways to optimize the ECS overall
- probably ALOT of ways to optimize the quadtree/collision
- 'cache' relevant entities on a per-system:s basis

- Partial updates for the cost_field
- limit cost_field range, and basically only make enemies whitin a certain
	simulation range have ai behavior

GAMEPLAY FEATURES
- reload time

KNOWN BUGS
- Colliding entities sometimes get stuck inside each other
- vsync/tearing issues? only my machine?
- Pathfinding AI:s sometimes(rarely) get stuck on walls
- Sometimes game starts in fullscreen, debug_camera and/or paused even when not
	set? some kind of UB bug idfk

NICE THINGS & TECH DEBT
- Start Menu
	- Options Menu?
	- better pause menu
- music & graphical assets
- further improved croshair feel
- refactor collision so entities can have collision callback functions?
- probably put callback functions in a hashmap
